# Demo project 

## In this demo I am testing juice-shop (https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop).

## Status 
The demo will be updated because I learn something new every day and implement it to the project.
## Features
In this project I used webdriverIO, mocha, chai, chance.js, allure reporter, superagent. 
For this moment I did UI positive and negative tests, API tests, where I used token to authorization.
